## Milestone 1 Feedback

Your purpose, audience, goal and persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. The only thing I can suggest is to include the OS on the tech section of the persona. Looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Your Milestone 2a looks great! You clearly put a lot of thought into how your website will present and I think it will end up looking great. One thing I would maybe want to know in reading your content strategy is more of what you hope to accomplish wiith each section - it's somewhat intuitive but it took me a second to understand what you meant by services. Just keep in mind who your audience is and that shouldn't be a problem. One question I had, for instance, is what the different is between the two services you showcase at the top of the page and the services you have listed out in the services section. You don't necessarily have to change it, just would want to minimize confusion there in your final site.

I wanted to highlight that having both a sticky header and footer has the potential to make a page look crowded, so keep that in mind as you develop. I also don't see in your wireframes where the testimonials you mentioned would go. I like the idea a lot, just didn't know where you planned to have them since they are scattered throughout the sections. 

Other than this general content feedback your HTML and wireframes looks great, and you turned it in early so your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier IV! Awesome job!
