## Milestone 1 Feedback

Your purpose, audience, goal and persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. The only thing I can suggest is to include the OS on the tech section of the persona. Looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.
