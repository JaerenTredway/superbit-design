			<!--Your persona should feature the following at minimum:
		Name
		A detailed description that includes demographic information such as: age, job or role, relevant technology being used, behaviors and attitudes, and the situation or scenario in which they will use your site.
		Goal(s) regarding the use of your site.
		Additional information regarding your persona may also include:

		Frustrations your persona may be facing.
		Additional information your persona may need in order to achieve their goal.

		 	Pictures are particularly useful as they help people to visualise the persona, to make it seem real. They also help designers/developers empathise with the personas more easily.
			A description gives a brief summary of the persona, which often contains demographic information (sometimes going into surprisingly large amounts of detail). The description might include (among other information) their job, their technology, any pressures they're under and the situation they're in when they use the system/site.
			Needs, goals & features can either be a straight list for each persona, or a table comparing each persona against each possible need/feature/goal. This can help define a priority list for features (or the needs from which to develop features) before development starts.

			A 'quote' from the persona
This should summarise their needs/goals into a single sentence. This can be a double edged sword, as this single sentence runs the risk of oversimplifying the personas issues. Quotes do have the added advantage of giving the personas further personality.
Frustrations
These are issues that the persona encounters, either with the existing system or because there's no existing system. These can clarify to designers/developers exactly what the biggest issues this persona faces.
Ideal features
This is very similar to features, but with no restrictions placed on their feasibility... these may be impossible to produce, but sometimes help designers/developers think of alternative approaches that are more realistic.
'Need to know'
Any information the persona needs when trying to do their goal. These help designers/developers understand the key information needed to communicate to users.
Behaviours
These are the typical behaviours the persona exhibits. They're usually only shown if the personas different behaviours lead to different needs/requirements of the system in development.
Scenarios
These are sample use cases the persona may do. They can be based on either their goals or their use of an existing system. This can clarify exactly how a system will be/is used.
